This project will consist of scraping multiple years of passing yards data from the NFL website. This data will combine total passing yards of each team and add them up for a total amount of passing yards for each year. Once the raw data has been retrieved and stored in Jupyter Notebook, it will be parsed to make it more comprehensible. When the data is cleaned up, I will analyze that data and compare it to rule changes made by the NFL to determine whether or not those rule changes had any correlation with the increase in annual passing yards over the years. The data will be visualized in a table so it is more easily digestible for those viewing the project. Markdowns will be included in each cell to explain why each step is taken.
