For this project, I will enter the data for Total Regular Season Passing Yards by creating Dictionaries. Each Dictionary will contain the Total Yards Passing of each NFL team, and there will be a Dictionary for each season between 2004 and 2021. Once the raw data has been added, I will use the LEN function to confirm no team was left out and the SUM function to add up the Team Totals to equal a League Total for each season. I wll clean it up further by formatting the values so that they contain commas. The data will be analyzed and compared to rule changes made by the NFL to determine whether or not those rule changes had any correlation with the increase in annual passing yards over the years. I will then move the data to Jupyter Notebook to add visualization with matplotlib so that it is easily digestible. Markdowns will be included in each cell to explain why each step is taken.
