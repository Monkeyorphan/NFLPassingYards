In this project, I will look at Total Regular Season Passing Yards data from the ESPN website. I will create a dictionary for each season from 2004 to 2021, combining the passing yards of each team and adding them up for a total amount of passing yards for each season, using the SUM function. Once the raw data has been entered, I will clean up by formatting it to add commas in the numbers. Once the data is cleaned up, I will transfer everything to Jupyter Notebook and use matplotlib to visualize it graphically so that it is more easily digestible for those viewing the project. I will analyze that data and compare it to rule changes made by the NFL to determine whether or not those rule changes had any correlation with the change in Total Regular Season Passing Yards over the seasons.  Markdowns will be included in each cell to explain why each step is taken.
