I first, created dictionaries of data from (https://www.espn.com/nfl/stats/team/_/stat/passing/table/passing/sort/netPassingYards/dir/desc), and then modified & exported data from https://www.pro-football-reference.com/, saving it to two separate CSV files."

    "Requirement 4: Visualize Your Data - I plotted the data from the two CSV files and also plotted the dictionary data just to show that there are multiple ways to enter and look at data. It can be seen that Total NFL Passing Yards has steadily increased throughout the years, while Total NFL Rushing Yards has remained fairly constant and has stayed within a much smaller range. This is likely due to rule changes made over the years that have made the game more pass friendly. It could also stem from the focus on getting Quarterbacks trained and ready at a much younger age and/or a shift in the most athletic players becoming Wide Receivers rather than Running Backs."
